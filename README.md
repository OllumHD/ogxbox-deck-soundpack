My soundpacks for the Audio Loader plugin.

## The OG Xbox Sounds
I have ripped all of the sounds used here straight from my Original Xbox via FTP. I did not use any outside sources or download links, they are uncompressed. 
They were all in a weird format (432kbps 48kHz Stereo WAV) that Windows Media Player and/or the Steam Deck could not read.
I put all the files into FL Studio, made all sounds quieter by 75% (or -5.9dB, some were also sped up slightly) and exported them to a standard WAV format (1411kbps).

```

```
